# TelegramBot_Agents with RAG Capabilities

## Overview

TelegramBot_Agents is an advanced Telegram bot implementation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. It combines the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a dynamic retrieval system to provide contextually relevant and informed responses to user queries.

## Core Components

1. TelegramBot_Agents: Main class handling Telegram API integration and overall bot management.
2. ConversationManager: Manages conversation flow, context retrieval, and response generation.
3. CommandHandler: Processes and executes bot commands.
4. AgentManager: Manages different types of agents (RAG, Tool, Conversation).
5. ToolManager: Handles tool-related operations and integrations.
6. PromptManager: Manages prompt templates and generation.
7. MemoryManager: Handles conversation memory and history.

## Key Features

- Integration with Telegram API
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality
- Dynamic context summarization
- Adaptive response generation
- Configurable system prompts
- Conversation memory management
- Tool integration capabilities
- Multi-modal support
- Group chat functionality with bot-specific interactions

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular "Lego-like" architecture, allowing for easy extension and modification of components.

## Authorization System

The TelegramBot_Agents implements a robust authorization system that handles both Telegram bot interactions and web application access. The system uses temporary authentication tokens and maintains user sessions with proper token management.

### Core Components

1. **AuthService**
   - Handles token generation, validation, and refresh operations
   - Key methods:
     - `generateTempAuthToken(userId: string)`: Creates JWT tokens for webapp auth
     - `refreshAuthToken(userId: string)`: Extends token validity if currently valid
     - `verifyTempAuthToken(token: string)`: Validates JWT tokens

2. **DatabaseService**
   - Manages token storage and validation in SQLite database
   - Key methods:
     - `hasValidAuthToken(userId: string)`: Checks token validity and expiry
     - `storeTempAuthToken(userId, token, expiryTime)`: Stores new auth tokens
     - `updateAuthTokenExpiry(userId, newExpiry)`: Updates token expiry times
     - `invalidateAuthTokenForUser(userId)`: Marks tokens as used/invalid

3. **AccountManager**
   - Handles user account operations and token usage
   - Key methods:
     - `validateMessageRequest(userId, input, source, auth?)`: Validates request auth
     - `updateTokenUsageFromText(userId, text, source)`: Updates usage and refreshes token
     - `getUserStats(userId)`: Retrieves user token usage statistics

### Authentication Flow

1. **Initial Authentication**
   - User starts with `/start auth` command in Telegram
   - `startCommand` in start.ts provides simplified auth-specific welcome
   - MenuManager generates auth token via `createStartInlineMenu`
   - Token stored in database with 30-minute expiry

2. **Web Application Access**
   - Web app requests include token in chatId format
   - `run` method in TelegramBot_Agents validates token:
     ```typescript
     if (webappData) {
         const normalizedUserId = `tg_${webappData.userId}`;
         const hasValidToken = await this.databaseService.hasValidAuthToken(normalizedUserId);
         // Handle auth status...
     }
     ```

3. **Token Refresh**
   - Tokens automatically refresh during active usage
   - Handled in `updateTokenUsageFromText`
   - 30-minute extension from last activity

4. **Token Validation**
   - Checks performed in SQLite using local time (AEST)
   - Tokens marked as used when expired
   - Validation includes:
     - Token existence
     - Expiry time
     - Used status

### User Stats and Token Usage

1. **Stats Tracking**
   - Token usage tracked per user
   - Stats included in API responses
   - Fields tracked:
     ```typescript
     {
         quota: number;
         used: number;
         remaining: number;
         total: number;
         messages: number;
         lastReset: string;
         nextReset: string | null;
         subscription: string;
     }
     ```

2. **Response Format**
   - Auth errors include current stats:
     ```typescript
     {
         text: 'ðŸ”’ Authentication Required',
         error: 'Authentication required',
         requireAuth: true,
         showAuthModal: true,
         metadata: {
             type: 'auth_error',
             timestamp: string,
             tokenStats: {...}
         }
     }
     ```

### Security Considerations

1. **Token Management**
   - Tokens expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
   - One active token per user
   - Automatic invalidation of expired tokens

2. **User ID Normalization**
   - Telegram IDs prefixed with 'tg_'
   - Consistent ID format across systems
   - Example: `tg_1234567890`

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful handling of expired tokens
   - Clear error messages
   - Automatic cleanup of invalid tokens

### Integration Points

1. **Telegram Bot**
   - `/start auth` command
   - Menu system for token generation
   - User account initialization

2. **Web Application**
   - Token validation on each request
   - Stats tracking and updates
   - Auth modal triggering

3. **Database**
   - Token storage
   - User stats tracking
   - Session management

This authorization system ensures secure access to the bot's capabilities while maintaining proper usage tracking and token management.

## User ID Normalization and Token Stats

### User ID Handling
- User IDs are normalized with a 'tg_' prefix for both Telegram and webapp users
- Important: Check for existing prefix before normalizing to avoid double prefixing
- Example: `1414981328` becomes `tg_1414981328`

### Token Stats Flow
1. In executeRun:
   ```typescript
   // Correct way to normalize userId
   const normalizedUserId = options.userId.startsWith('tg_') ? 
       options.userId : 
       `tg_${options.userId}`;
